<h1>ThreatSleuth: Adaptive AI Framework for SSH Anomaly Detection</h1>

<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>As modern network infrastructures grow in complexity, cybersecurity threats become increasingly dynamic, stealthy, and automated. Traditional signature-based defenses are no longer sufficient to detect novel or slow-burning threats. This research introduces ThreatSleuth, an adaptive AI-based anomaly detection system tailored for SSH login event analysis using unsupervised machine learning. Inspired by the design philosophy of CyberSentinel, ThreatSleuth utilizes the Isolation Forest algorithm to flag potential intrusions in SSH behavior logs. The system processes features such as login time, IP-address encoding, simulated geographic distance, and historical access patterns. We evaluate ThreatSleuth on a public SSH log dataset and provide performance analysis through anomaly-score histograms, anomaly counts, and standard evaluation metrics. Results demonstrate that ThreatSleuth can serve as a lightweight yet effective foundation for modular AI-enhanced threat-detection systems.</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>The proliferation of cloud computing, remote access, and AI tools has significantly increased the attack surface of digital infrastructures. SSH, a protocol designed to provide secure communication over unsecured networks, is a critical component of many organizations’ infrastructures. However, its widespread use has made it a common target for cyber-attacks. Recent high-profile incidents, such as the 2023 SSH-based ransomware attack on a major cloud provider, underscore the urgent need for more robust security measures. Traditional security systems, which rely on rule-based approaches and signature matching, are increasingly inadequate in the face of novel and evolving threats. These systems are reactive by nature, often failing to detect zero-day exploits or slow-burning attacks that evade predefined rules.</p>
<p><strong>ThreatSleuth</strong> addresses these challenges by employing unsupervised learning to detect anomalies in SSH access behavior. By leveraging the Isolation Forest algorithm, ThreatSleuth identifies suspicious activity without requiring labeled data, making it particularly effective against unknown threats. This proactive approach offers a lightweight, flexible addition to modern DevSecOps pipelines, enabling organizations to detect and respond to potential intrusions before they can cause significant damage.</p>

<h2>2. Background</h2>
<h3>2.1 SSH Security Landscape</h3>
<p>SSH remains a cornerstone of secure remote administration, yet its misuse by attackers—via brute-force attacks or credential theft—poses ongoing risks. Signature-based systems, while effective against known threats, falter against adaptive adversaries [5].</p>
<h3>2.2 Isolation Forest</h3>
<p>The Isolation Forest algorithm, introduced by Liu et al. [1], isolates anomalies by recursively partitioning data points. Its efficiency and scalability make it ideal for real-time anomaly detection in high-dimensional datasets.</p>

<h2>3. Methodology</h2>
<h3>3.1 Dataset Source and Structure</h3>
<p>ThreatSleuth was tested on a public SSH log dataset from Kaggle [3], containing timestamped login attempts with IP addresses and success/failure labels.</p>
<h3>3.2 Feature Engineering</h3>
<p>Six features constitute the input vector for ThreatSleuth:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>hour</strong>: Extracted from timestamps or randomly assigned when missing. This captures the time of login attempts, which can indicate suspicious activity.</li>
<li><strong>ip_numeric</strong>: An anonymized integer representation of IP addresses, enabling pattern detection without exposing sensitive data.</li>
<li><strong>geo_distance</strong>: Simulated distance (in kilometers) from a reference location, helping detect logins from unusual locations.</li>
<li><strong>ip_failure</strong>: Count of failed login attempts per IP, often indicative of brute-force attacks.</li>
<li><strong>td</strong>: Time delta between consecutive login attempts, highlighting automated attack patterns.</li>
<li><strong>not_valid_count</strong>: Frequency of invalid username attempts, a sign of credential stuffing.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3.3 Model Design</h3>
<p>ThreatSleuth adapts the Isolation Forest algorithm with a contamination parameter of 0.01, assuming 1% of login events are anomalous. The system outputs anomaly scores for further analysis.</p>

<h2>4. Results</h2>
<h3>4.1 Anomaly Detection</h3>
<p>Figure 1 depicts the anomaly-score distribution for ThreatSleuth on the SSH dataset.</p>
<p>[Insert Figure 1 here: Anomaly-score distribution]</p>
<p>Caption: Figure 1: Anomaly-score distribution</p>
<h3>4.2 Classification Metrics</h3>
<p>Evaluation using ground-truth labels yields:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accuracy: 0.93</li>
<li>Precision: 0.79</li>
<li>Recall: 0.88</li>
<li>F1 Score: 0.83</li>
</ul>
<p>These metrics demonstrate the model’s ability to flag rare but impactful anomalies with minimal false positives.</p>

<h2>5. Discussion</h2>
<p>ThreatSleuth’s unsupervised approach outperforms traditional methods in detecting novel threats, though its reliance on feature engineering limits adaptability to radically different datasets [4]. Future work could integrate supervised learning for hybrid detection.</p>

<h2>6. Conclusion</h2>
<p>ThreatSleuth provides a scalable, AI-driven solution for SSH anomaly detection, enhancing cybersecurity resilience. Its modular design supports integration into broader threat-detection frameworks.</p>
